/* Question: Check if bits of a number has count of consecutive set bits in increasing order
Given a integer n > 0, the task is to find whether in the bit pattern of integer count of continuous 1â€™s are in increasing from left to right.
Examples:

Input:19
Output:Yes
Explanation: Bit-pattern of 19 = 10011,
Counts of continuous 1's from left to right 
are 1, 2 which are in increasing order.

Input  : 183
Output : yes
Explanation: Bit-pattern of 183 = 10110111,
Counts of continuous 1's from left to right 
are 1, 2, 3 which are in increasing order.

/* Solution: One solution very well could be to traverse from left to right
 * and see if the numbers are increasing by compareing the last increasing count
 * to the previous one. If you have then print yes or no
 * BUT the efficient solution is to traverse the number bit by a while loop and dividing
 * it by 2 to get the remainder and filling bits from left side. Increase the count and 
 * compare with the previous count to see if it is in increasing order.
